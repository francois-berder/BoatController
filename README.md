# PIC24 framework

This project provides a framework for 16bit PIC microcontrollers to ease development of future firmware

It contains abstraction for:
  - UART
  - GPIO
  - Timer 1
  - Timer 2/3/4/5...
  - I2C
  - SPI
  - Hardware RNG
  - Input Capture

For now, only the PIC24F128GB202 is supported.
